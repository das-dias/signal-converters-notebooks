    "The input of almost every comparator topology is based on the use of a differential pair. Due to mismatching, the employed transistors in the implementation of the input differential pair usually present different gate width and length dimensions, which ultimately affects the DC operating point of the comparator. This mismatching leads to a voltage offset between both inputs of the comparator. Of course that this offset is also present at the output of the circuit, once a comparator is basically an unstable amplifier with a \"linear\" response.\n",

This offset is usually modelled as a random variable following a normal distribution with a mean of zero and a standard deviation equal to the maximum offset amplitude (Vofst). The decisions happening \"sooner\" or \"later\", in relation to the voltage reference, will provoke missing-codes in the ADC's transfer function.\n",
