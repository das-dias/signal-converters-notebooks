The sub ADCs feature loop-unrolling, using a comparator for each bit extraction in an assynchronous fashion for each successive bit, reducing the timing diagram of the SAR-ADCs to a single conversion period and a single reset period.\n",

    "<ul align=\"left\">\n",
    "\n",
    "<il> 1 - The SAR-ADC uses an assynchronous comparator for the extraction of each bit (loop-unrolling technique) - not the classical architecture of a single comparator for all bits; </il>\n",
    "\n",
    "<il> 2 - The differential architecture of the SAR-ADC enables to extract the Most Significant Bit for free right after sampling, without using the DAC capacitive arrays, using comparator D5; </il>\n",
    "\n",
    "<il> 3 - The SAR-ADC is performing bottom-sampling to sample the input differential signal, and as such, the first step after sampling is encharged of transposing the input signal from the bottom plate to the top plate of the capacitors of the DAC array, where the comparators are connected to; </il>\n",
    "\n",
    "<il> 4 - The capacitive DAC arrays feature a split-capacitor architecture, unfolding the capacitance of each element in half. This enables the split capacitor to have one of its bottom plates connected to VREF- and the other to VREF+ at all times during bit extraction - thus allowing the voltage at the top plate of the capacitor array to stay relatively stable around the common mode voltage VCM. The stability of the top plate voltage around VCM is very important to maintain the correct operation and operating point of the comparators D<5:0>.</il>\n",
    "\n",
    "<il> 5 - After each bit decision, if the current bit is a logical \"1\", then the bottom plates of the corresponding positive(top)-array split-capacitor are connected to VREF+ / VREF-, and consequently the bottom plates of the corresponding negative(bottom)-array split-capacitor are connected to VREF- / VREF+, symmetrically. This will pull the top plate voltage of the positive capacitor array upwards, and pull the top plate voltage of the negative capacitor array downwards, adjusting the decision scale for each comparator. </il>\n"

In this case, the top plate voltage of the positive capacitor array will be pulled downwards, and the top plate voltage of the negative capacitor array will be pushed upwards, once again adjusting the decision scale for each comparator. </il> \n",
